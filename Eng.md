# Introduction

`FOR THE ENGLISH SPEAKERS THE PROCESS AND TASKS COULD BE SLIGTHLY DIFFERENT! PLEASE, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE - REACH US OUT!`
> On 23.04.2024, [Content SubDAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1ujl7hlglktdll3g8d3sttw83vw969ncwl3npzfaj7qplgzhhu92qdfdte4) was created to elevate content production to a new level. Until this point, most content production by [POSTHUMAN DAS](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1h5ex5dn62arjwvwkh88r475dap8qppmmec4sgxzmtdn5tnmke3lqwpplgg/treasury) was managed, published, and processed by two people, [Synthetic](https://github.com/SyntheticV) and [Medniyy](https://github.com/Medniyy). Due to the active growth of the community, the amount of produced content increased significantly. However, two people alone cannot effectively distribute all the POSTHUMAN DAS content to where it is needed and in the required formats. To address this bottleneck, the decision was made to scale and distribute responsibilities among other active community members who are also interested in the development of POSTHUMAN DAS, the decentralized validator POSTHUMAN, find themselves, and be part of something bigger. <br/>

### **_Besides Content SubDAO, there are more than 10 other SubDAOs with different focuses._** <br/>

## Why is this needed?

> We believe we are engaged in interesting and useful work. The creation of a decentralized corporation cannot be concentrated on a small group of people; the more participants involved, the more actively the corporation grows, thereby increasing its value, and along with it, your own. We also had to work on our own EGO, as we did. The EGO tells us to take more and more for ourselves, not to give anything to anyone, not to share. But as soon as the POSTHUMAN validator began to distribute its EGO, its resources, income, and responsibility - the project's growth accelerated exponentially.

## What does participation offer?

**<details><summary>BRIEF LIST</summary>**

> Everyone always chooses for themselves what they want to do, who they want to be. If you don't choose, it's a clear reason to think. Here is a brief (not exhaustive) list of what you can gain from participating in various SubDAOs:

### Right to Self-Determination

No one tells you who to be. If you enjoy creativity - engage in creativity. If you are impressed by finance - engage in finance. If you are searching for yourself - try different things until you find what you like.

### Absence of Judgment

We do not categorize or label people. People on the internet, Earthlings, why feud when we can be friends?

### Friendly and Experienced Community

In our communities, we cultivate a culture and respect for other members. If you are just starting your journey, we will support and guide you. We won't do everything for you, but we are ready to share knowledge and experience.

### Acquiring New Skills and Improving Existing Ones

By creating value - you learn. I always perceive all my actions as a paid internship, or advanced training courses, or as leveling up my character. Well-edited video - improved Editor skills. Well-made infographics - improved Designer skills. Well-translated text - improved Polyglot skills, and so on.

### Rewards

POSTHUMAN DAS has resources. They are in its treasury. These resources will return many times over if distributed and supported by those who support you. We always support active community members who bring value to POSTHUMAN DAS and the POSTHUMAN validator.

## Reward and Evaluation Order

> The primary support format is the PHMN token. It is an extremely scarce resource that is the governance token of POSTHUMAN DAS, the POSTHUMAN validator, and in general, the decentralized corporation. We would very much like participants and active contributors to use it wisely, understand the ideas behind the validator, and everything related to it. Locking coins in DAS is the ideal option that we like the most. You can spend it on necessary needs, request compensation for tools you need for work. If these are small expenses within $50 and you can justify them - we will confidently compensate them. If they exceed this limit, let's agree on it in the [Content SubDAO chat](https://t.me/+yC2Ju8HFPqMxNzEy). The PHMN tokenomics is outlined until 2030, and the token's liquidity is replenished from 20% of the [POSTHUMAN validator](https://posthuman.digital/) income.

## Participation Procedure

> We want to come to a format where the participation of the CORE-TEAM in the processes you do is minimal. You choose the format that suits you for contributing. One example of interaction:

You see that a new episode of [Voice of the Ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5Flip26ao) has been released on the [CryptoBase YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT8g3Ki-EO0UHhP2DFPXi2A) and understand that you can scale its presence. <br/> You inform that you want to do something from the following or regularly perform some of the content production cycles, for example

:

You can (not a complete list):
- Upload the video to [Omniflix TV](https://omniflix.tv/)
- Create shorts from useful moments, adapting it to the required format, adding subtitles.
- Cut out a piece that can be useful as a separate video (exclude the part with only one language, as we have English-speaking speakers, separately take a piece as an instruction that can be a useful separate video)
- Translate the video with dubbing into other languages (preferably, if you want and can do this - do it regularly). Want to use neural networks - please, want to dub yourself - please!
- Add metadata to the video (hashtags)
- Upload the video to YouTube (we provide the original)
- Distribute the video on social networks (we will give access)
- Write a description for the video that matches the video language and reflects its content.
- See that you can do something else that is not on the list, but you think it will be useful - let's discuss!

> Once we understand that you want to do this regularly and qualitatively, we publicly hand over what you chose, and periodically distribute rewards among active participants and DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS. If we see that the mechanism is established and works, you DO NOT NEED to inform us about what you plan to do, once we reach a consensus, you decide how, what, and when to do.

### **After you've done something, let's tell everyone about it!**<br/>
> [Here we will collect the list of what you've done, and you can submit a pull request and add your contributions here.](https://github.com/Validator-POSTHUMAN/Content-SubDAO/blob/main/Community%20contributions.md)
